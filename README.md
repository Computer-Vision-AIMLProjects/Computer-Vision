This repository is a curated collection of Python scripts and demos exploring practical computer vision tasks, including but not limited to:

* Barcode detection (1D / 2D, oriented / skewed)
* Real-time detection via camera
* Face detection (using YOLO, MediaPipe, etc.)
* Comparing images from multiple cameras
* Integration with Google Cloud Vision API
* Handling blurry input, tilted images, color-based filtering, LED-barcode combinations

Each example is designed for hands-on use: feel free to clone and experiment, adapt the code for your own projects, or use them for learning and prototyping.

**Features:**

* Pure Python implementations (100% of code is in Python) ([GitHub][1])
* Many small focused scripts tackling specific subproblems (e.g. barcode, face, tracking) ([GitHub][1])
* Demonstrations on handling distortions, tilt, blur, color filtering, multi-camera setups ([GitHub][1])

**Usage & Contribution:**

* Clone the repository and run individual `.py` scripts
* Use as reference or learning resource
* Contributions, enhancements, or additional use cases are welcome
